        <h2>Chili with Chorizo and Chocolate</h2>
        <p>The smokiness of the bacon and liquid smoke complements the spiciness of the chorizo and sweetness of the chocolate in this chili. Just like any other chili, this is better the next day. Serve with a dollop of cilantro sour cream or some chocolate shavings.</p>
        <p>This recipe was tweaked from another recipe on this site and has taken (4) first place prizes in chili cook-offs. The sweetness and spice makes people wonder what is different, setting you apart from the rest.</p>

                <li>Bring to a boil; reduce heat to a simmer and add jalapenos, kidney beans, black beans, and chocolate. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors are well blended, about 2 hours. Serve.</li>
